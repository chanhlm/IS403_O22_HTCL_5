	\section{Methodology}
	\subsection{Linear Regression}
	Simple linear regression describes the relationship between one variable's magnitude and that of another—for instance, as X increases, Y might also increase, or it could decrease. The difference is that while correlation measures the strength of an association between two variables, regression quantifies the nature of the relationship. \cite{b7}\\
	A simple linear regression model has the form:
	\[Y=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1\]
	Where:\\
	\indent\textbullet\ Y is the dependent variable (Target Variable).\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(X_1, X_2\) are the independent (explanatory) variables.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_0\) is the intercept term.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_1\) is the regression coefficient for the independent variable.\\
	When there are multiple predictors, the equation is extended to accommodate them: Multiple Linear Regression. Instead of a line, we now have a linear model—the relationship between each coefficient and its variable (feature) is linear.
	\[Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1+\beta_2 X_2+\cdots+\beta_k X_k+\varepsilon\]
	Where:\\
	\indent\textbullet\ Y is the dependent variable (Target Variable).\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k\) are the independent (explanatory) variables.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_0\) is the intercept term.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_1,..., \beta_k\) are the regression coefficients for the independent variables.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\varepsilon\) is the error term.
	
	\subsection{ARIMA}
	The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) \cite{b8} model utilizes time-series data and statistical analysis to interpret the data and forecast future values. ARIMA aims to understand data patterns by analyzing its past values and employs linear regression to make predictions.\\
	The ARIMA model is typically denoted with the parameters (p, d, q), which can be assigned different values to modify the model and apply it in different ways.\\
	Some of the limitations of the model are its dependency on data collection and the manual trial-and-error process required to determine parameter values that fit best. \\
	Meaning of each component in the Arima model:\\
	\indent \textbullet\ \textbf{AutoRegression (AR)}: refers to a model that shows a changing variable that regresses on its own lagged, or prior, values.\\
	The form of AR is: 
	\[Y_t=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 y_{t-1}+\alpha_2 y_{t-2}+\cdots+\alpha_p y_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t\]
	Where:\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(Y_t\) is the current value.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\alpha_0\) is the constant term.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ p is the number of orders.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\alpha_1,..., \alpha_p\) are the auto-regression coefficient.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\varepsilon_t\) is the error term.\\
	
	\indent \textbullet\ \textbf{Integrated (I)}: represents the differencing of raw observations to allow the time series to become stationary.
	\indent \textbullet\ \textbf{Moving Average (MA)}: incorporates the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.\\
	The form of MA is:
	\[Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}+\beta_2 \varepsilon_{t-2}+\cdots+\beta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}+\varepsilon_t\]
	Where:\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(Y_t\) is current observed value.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\varepsilon_{t-1}, \varepsilon_{t-2}, \ldots, \varepsilon_{t-q}\) are forecast error.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_0\) is the intercept term.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\beta_1,..., \beta_q\) mean values of \(Y_t\) and moving average coefficients.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\varepsilon_{t}\) random forecasting error of the current period. The expected mean value is 0.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ q is the number of past errors used in the moving average.
	
	\subsection{Holt-Winters}
	The Holt-Winters model is a time series forecasting method developed by Charles Holt and Peter Winters in 1960. It is a linear model used to forecast values in a time series with trends and seasonality that vary over time.\\
	Holt-Winters is a model of time series behavior. Forecasting always requires a model, and Holt-Winters is a way to model three aspects of the time series: a typical value (average), a slope (trend) over time, and a cyclical repeating pattern (seasonality). \cite{b9}\\
	The formula for the basic version of the Holt-Winters model (simple exponential smoothing) is:
	\begin{align*}
		F(t+1) &= \alpha Y(t) + (1-\alpha)(F(t) + T(t))
	\end{align*}
	Where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( Y(t) \) is the value at time \( t \).
		\item \( F(t) \) is the forecasted value at time \( t \).
		\item \( T(t) \) is the trend value at time \( t \).
		\item \( \alpha \) is the model's smoothing constant ranging from 0 to 1, determining the importance of past values for the current forecast.
	\end{itemize}
	
	The formula for the enhanced version of the Holt-Winters model (Holt's linear exponential smoothing) is:
	\begin{align*}
		F(t+1) &= \alpha Y(t) + (1-\alpha)(F(t) + T(t)) \\
		T(t+1) &= \beta*(F(t+1)-F(t)) + (1-\beta)*T(t)
	\end{align*}
	Where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( \beta \) is the model's coefficient for trend, ranging from 0 to 1, determining the importance of trend changes for the forecast.
	\end{itemize}
	The formula for the enhanced version of the Holt-Winters model with seasonality adds a seasonal factor to the enhanced model's formula.
	\begin{align*}
		F(t+1) &= \alpha(Y(t) - S(t-m)) + (1-\alpha)(F(t) + T(t)) \\
		T(t+1) &= \beta*(F(t+1)-F(t)) + (1-\beta)*T(t) \\
		S(t+1) &= \gamma(Y(t) - F(t+1)) + (1-\gamma)*S(t-m+1)
	\end{align*}
	Where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( S(t-m) \) is the seasonal value at time \( t-m \), with \( m \) being the number of repetitions in the seasonal cycle.
		\item \( \gamma \) is the model's coefficient for seasonality, ranging from 0 to 1, determining the importance of seasonal changes for the forecast.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Support Vector Machine - SVM}
	Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of machine learning algorithm used for regression analysis. The goal of SVR is to find a function that approximates the relationship between the input variables and a continuous target variable, while minimizing the prediction error. \\
	Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principle as SVM, but for regression problems.\\
	SVR can handle non-linear relationships between the input variables and the target variable by using a kernel function to map the data to a higher-dimensional space. This makes it a powerful tool for regression tasks where there may be complex relationships between the input variables and the target variable. \cite{b10}
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		% \captionsetup{justification=centering}
		\caption{Kernels used in the Support Vector Machine}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
			\hline
			\textbf{Kernel} & \textbf{Equation} \\ \hline
			Linear & ${x^T z}$ \\ \hline
			Polynomial & $\left( r + \gamma {x^T z} \right)^d$ \\ \hline
			RBF & $\exp \left( -\gamma \frac{\|x - z\|_2^2}{2\sigma^2} \right), \gamma > 0$ \\ \hline
			Sigmoid & $\tanh \left( \gamma {x^T z} + r \right)$ \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)}
	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data. They analyze data with a temporal dimension, such as time series, speech, and text. RNNs achieve this by using a hidden state that is passed from one timestep to the next, allowing information to persist and be utilized across different points in the sequence \cite{b11}.
	\begin{figure}[H] % Use [H] to force the figure to stay here
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{bibliography/material/RNN_process.png}
		\caption{Source: Quora.com}
	\end{figure}
	\noindent All inputs and outputs in standard neural networks operate independently from each other. However, in certain situations, such as predicting the next word in a phrase, the preceding words are essential, necessitating the retention of previous words.\\
	RNNs possess a memory that retains all information related to the calculations. They use the same parameters for each input because they achieve consistent outcomes by performing the same operations on all inputs or hidden layers \cite{b12}.
	
	\subsection{Long short-term memory (LSTM)}
	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture in deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTMs incorporate feedback connections, enabling them to utilize temporal dependencies in data sequences.\\ 
	They are designed to handle the problem of diminishing or exploding gradients that can arise when training traditional RNNs on sequential data. This makes LSTMs particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting \cite{b13}.

	\noindent \textbf{Forget Gate}: $f_t = (W_f[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f$ \\
	\textbf{Input Gate}: $i_t = (W_i[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i$ \\
	\textbf{Output Gate}: $o_t = (W_o[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o$\\
	\textbf{Temporary cell state}: \[\tilde{C}_t = \tanh(W_c[h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_c\]
	\textbf{Current cell state}: $C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t$ \cite{b14}
	
	\subsection{Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)}
	The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs, such as the vanishing gradient problem. GRUs have proven effective in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction \cite{b15}.
	\begin{figure}[H] % Use [H] to force the figure to stay here
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{bibliography/material/gru.png}
		\caption{Architecture and Working of GRU}
	\end{figure}
	\noindent Similar to LSTM, GRU is designed to model sequential data by allowing information to be selectively retained or discarded over time. However, GRU has a simpler architecture with fewer parameters, making it easier to train and more computationally efficient.\\
	The primary difference between GRU and LSTM lies in how they manage the memory cell state. In LSTM, the memory cell state is maintained separately from the hidden state and updated using three gates: the input gate, output gate, and forget gate. In contrast, GRU replaces the memory cell state with a “candidate activation vector,” which is updated using two gates: the reset gate and the update gate \cite{b16}.
	
	\subsection{Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)}
	
	A MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network is a type of feedforward artificial neural network with multiple layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.\\
	\begin{figure}[H] % Use [H] to force the figure to stay here
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{bibliography/material/mlp.jpg}
		\caption{Architecture and Working of MLP}
	\end{figure}
	The input layer receives input from the dataset, the hidden layer processes computations using activation functions, and the output layer provides the estimated output. Each layer is fully connected to the next, and it utilizes the BackPropagation algorithm for training.\\
	The input nodes pass data to the hidden layer, where computations are performed using weighted edges and activation functions. The output is then generated and compared with the actual output, and the BackPropagation algorithm is used to adjust weights and reduce error. \\
	The MLP Neural Network is widely used in various applications such as image classification and regression prediction. Its effectiveness depends on the problem type and dataset characteristics. \cite{b17} \\
	
	
	\section{Result}
	\subsection{Evaluation Methods}
	\textbf{Mean Absolute Percentage Error} (MAPE): is the average percentage error in a set of predicted values. \cite{b18}
	\[MAPE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y_i}}{y_i} \right| \times 100\%\]
	\textbf{Root Mean Squared Error} (RMSE): is the square root of average value of squared error in a set of predicted values. \cite{b19}
	\[RMSE=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(\hat{y_i}-y_i )^2}{n} }\]
	\textbf{Mean Absolute Error} (MAE):is a measure of the average size of the mistakes in a collection of predictions, without taking their direction into account. \cite{b20} \[MAE=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})}{n}\]
	
	Where: \\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(n\) is the number of observations in the dataset.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(y_i\)  is the true value.\\
	\indent\textbullet\ \(\hat{y_i}\) is the predicted value.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\subsection{Summary} 
	
	In the realm of stock price forecasting, a spectrum of methodologies has been explored, ranging from traditional statistical models to sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Among the models investigated include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Holt-Winters, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). It has become evident through this exploration that SVM, LSTM, GRU, RNN, and MLP emerge as the most effective models for predicting stock prices. \\
	The intricacies of forecasting stock prices, deeply rooted in the complexity and unpredictability of financial markets, necessitate models capable of capturing subtle patterns and relationships within the data. SVM demonstrates its effectiveness in handling complex relationships, while LSTM and GRU excel in learning long-term dependencies. RNN proves adept at forecasting stock prices by leveraging sequential dependencies, and MLP offers flexibility and high accuracy in prediction models. These models consistently demonstrate superior performance across various evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, and MAE, showcasing their adaptability to navigate the inherent uncertainties of stock markets. As such, they serve as formidable tools for investors and analysts seeking reliable predictions. 
	\subsection{Future Considerations}
	In our future research, it is crucial to prioritize further optimization of the previously mentioned models. This optimization effort should specifically focus on:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Enhancing the accuracy of the model. While the above algorithms have demonstrated promising results in predicting stock prices, there is a need to further improve the model's accuracy to ensure more precise forecasting outcomes.
		\item Exploring alternative machine learning algorithms or ensemble techniques. Ensemble techniques, such as combining multiple models or using various ensemble learning methods, can also improve the robustness and accuracy of the forecasts.
		\item Researching new forecasting models. The field of forecasting continuously evolves, with new algorithms and models being researched and developed. It is crucial to stay updated with these approaches and explore new forecasting models that offer improved accuracy and performance.
	\end{itemize}
	By continuously exploring and incorporating new features, data sources, and modeling techniques, we can strive for ongoing optimization of the forecasting models and enhance their ability to predict stock prices with greater precision and reliability.
